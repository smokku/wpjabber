concurrent users. WPJabber uses pthreads and can work on 
multi-processor platforms. WPJabber needs thread safe modules.

 - JSM - Session Manager
 - WPJ - Connection Manager ( c2s module )
 - dialback and dnsrv - modules needed to connect with other servers
 - xdb_file
 - xdb_sql - SQL storage module

Source includes example files for each module.
More docs and FAQ can be found in doc/ dir.
