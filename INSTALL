=================================================
I. Compile

do ./configure
then make

If you have problems compiling WPJ read WPJ/README.
You don't need WPJ to run wpjabber. You can use other c2s server.
You can remove wpj_epoll from Makefile.

It is recommended to configure with  --nodebug

================================================

II. Prepare to run:

Created binary files:  jabberd, jsm.so, xdb_file.so and others.

2. Copy files and prepare right config file.

For example:
Create dirs:
 /opt/jabber
 /opt/jabber/bin
 /opt/jabber/lib
 /opt/jabber/etc
 /opt/jabber/log

Copy: 
  jabberd to /opt/jabber/bin
  libs ( *.so ) to /opt/jabber/lib
  jabber.xml ( *.xml - config filef ) to /opt/jabber/etc


-------------
XDB_FILE

WPJabber xdb_file is not compatible with old xdb_file due
to other directory managment.
In wpjabber xdb_file creates directories like this:
./spool/roster/localhost/XX/YY/file.xml

Where XX and YY are generated names based on file.xml.

To copy old structure to new structure read xdb_file/README

========================================================
III. Config file.

Read example file.

In config file:
- be sure you have right path to modules in <load> sections



Prepare wpj.xml config file.


========================================================
IV. How to run

jabberd options: 
  -H home_dir       
  -c config_file
  -D               
  

Execute: 
  ./jabberd -H /opt/jabber -c /opt/jabber/etc/jabber.xml

to run wpjabber

--------------
WPJabber needs separated c2s module like WPJ.

to run wpj type:
 ./wpj -c /opt/jabber/etc/wpj.xml
