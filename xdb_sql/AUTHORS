This program is based on the xdb_mysql (Jabber 1.0 transport module)
initially developed by the Jabber Team (Eric Bowersox
<erbo@jabber.org> ?), under an undefined distribution policy.


The code was improved for compatibility with Jabber 1.1 and DB
abstraction, by IDEALX (http://www.IDEALX.org), for LibertySurf
Télécom (http://www.libertysurftelecom.fr).

Active members of the xdb_sql development project have been :
 David Barth <david.barth@IDEALX.com>,
 Rodolphe Dugé de Bernonville,
 David Le Corfec, 
 Julien Pinon.

Current Maintainer :
 Benoit Orihuela <orihuela@free.fr>

Thanks to Aurelien Gateau (<aurelien@notrefamille.com>) for its patch
to add ODBC support to xdb_sql.

Thanks to Pier Philipsen (<pier.philipsen@lostboys.nl>) for sample
database documentation and suggestions.

Thanks to Felipe Madero (<fmadero@hal.famaf.unc.edu.ar>) for MUC
support and other improvments.

The program xdb_sql was made Open Source software (see COPYING and the
source files headers) by LibertySurf Télécom, in order to make it
available for public distribution and modification, and to contribute
to the Jabber code base.
