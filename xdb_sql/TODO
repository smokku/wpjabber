TODO-list :

	* Maybe, change the way tables are joined. Currently, this is
	  done with the username field. It would be a better idea to
	  join them via an integer.

	* Managing errors :
	  There is a no way to make a difference between a critical
	  error and a normal one.

	  The different kind of errors from xdb_sql, roughly sorted
	  from the most critical to the less are :
	    Configuration error :
	      a querydef is missing or invalid in the configuration file
	      No connection to the database.
	    Query errors :
	      Connection to the database lost.
	    User not specified :
	      The xml query contains no username.
	    User not unique :
	      He should be.
	    User not found :
	      The querying user is not in the base.
