"The crash occured in the handle_query_v1() (see xdb_sql_config.c)
function with the call to the validate function. This only caused a
problem for the vcard-get and vcard-set queries. I "solved" the
problem by skipping the call to the validate function :

      if ((*(self->query_table[i].validate_func))(x)) {

This way it doesn't check the configuration XML, but it works anyway.
This probably will not help you very much, because I guess that this
problem doesn't happen in your environment (mine is FreeBSD)."
