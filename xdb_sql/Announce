Here is the first public release of xdb_sql, labeled 1.0-pre-1
It implements only basic functionalities (auth, roster, offline, register)

We plan to improve it ! from TODO file :

	  V 1.x 
	
	      All Jabber 1.4 fonctionnalities
	
	
	  V 2.x 
	      Non-blocking mode (PostgreSQL, perhaps MySQL)
	      MIO based
	      CancelRequest support
	      Full generic query mapping
	      Db reconnect support
	      Stress test suite
	      Better error handling
	      Jabber:x:expire handling (internal, without server manually
	      Expiring messages, perhaps with a stored trigger, what about
	      MySQL ?)


	  V 3.0 

	      Posix Threads


We hope the README file provides enough help on using it.
