	* sample_database.sql, sample_database.pg.sql, xdb_sql.c,
	xdb_sql_backend.c, xdb_sql_config.c, xdb_sql.h,
	xdb_sql_oracle.xml, xdb_sql_roomconfig.c, xdb_sql_roomoutcast.c,
	xdb_sql.xml : added MUC support, better backend initialization
	handling, better shutdown handling (from Felipe Madero's patch) 

dim jan 12 18:04:46 2003  bobeal  <orihuela@free.fr>

	* xdb_sql_backend.c: added support for Oracle backend (from Mike
	Shoyher's patch)

	* sample_database.oracle.sql, xdb_sql_oracle.h, xdb_sql_oracle.c,
	xdb_sql_oracle.xml : new files for Oracle backend (from Mike
	Shoyher's patch) 

	* Makefile: integrated Mike Shoyher's patch to make easier
	choosing of backends

	* xdb_sql_querydef.c : added optional "length" attribute to
	bindvars.  Oracle doesn't like if one passes a value which is
	longer than a column (postgres just truncates it but oracle raises
	an error) so I've added truncation if there is a length attribute
	specified. Also if an empty string was passed for a bindvar that
	has a default value, it will be replaced with the default
	value. (from Mike Shoyher's patch)
